# angular-pane-manager-example

This project shows off a simple example usage of [`angular-pane-manager`] and provides the Angular project scaffolding to build and publish the library.

`app.component.html` and `app.component.ts` show off some basics of the library, such as pane creation and layout save/restore.  `app.component.scss` contains a minimal stylesheet for the pane manager components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
